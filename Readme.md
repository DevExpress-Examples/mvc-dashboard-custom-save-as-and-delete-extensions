# Dashboard for MVC - How to implement Save As and Delete functionality by creating custom extensions

This example shows how to implement [custom extensions](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/117543) that add the "Save As" and "Delete" [menu items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/117444) to the Web Dashboard's UI:

* The "Save As" menu item allows users to save the current dashboard with a new name.
* The "Delete" menu item deletes the opened dashboard from [dashboard storage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116299).

The image below shows the result of the extensions implementation:

To add this functionality to your application, [add](./CS/MVC_WebDashboard/Views/Home/Index.cshtml#L5-L6) the extension scripts to the page and [register](./CS/MVC_WebDashboard/Views/Home/Index.cshtml#L16-L17) the extensions in the control with the [DashboardControl.registerExtension](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/js-DevExpress.Dashboard.DashboardControl?p=netframework#js_devexpress_dashboard_dashboardcontrol_registerextension_extensions_) method call. 

These extensions also require server configuration.
